<h2>Description</h2>
<p>"Homemade lasagna may have a few steps, but each step is easy – and I assure you it’s worth the time; the perfect Italian meal!</p>
<p></p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Meat: This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.</li>
    <li>Onion and garlic: An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.</li>
    <li>Tomato products: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</li>
    <li>Sugar: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</li>
    <li>Spices and seasonings: This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</li>
    <li>Lasagna noodles: Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</li>
    <li>Cheeses: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</li>
    <li>Egg: An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Start by making the sauce with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.</li>
    <li>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready. We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!</li>
    <li>From there, it's just an assembly job. A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.</li>
    <li>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</li>
